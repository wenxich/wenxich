Hi there! I’m Wenxi, a programmer/artist currently studying **Computer Science** and **Design**. Several things about me:

- I'm a big **creative coding** enthusiast - huge believer that code can be a medium of expression. There are so many ways we can play with [human-computer interaction](https://artofweb.neocities.org/s3/a1), experiment with [user input](https://artofweb.neocities.org/s3/final), and design [unique experiences](https://artofweb.neocities.org/).

- I also enjoy learning about history and how it relates to the use and development of current technologies. Currently, I'm reading [Viral Justice](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/viral-justice) by Ruha Benjamin. *(Updated 6/25/24)* I also recommend reading the following:
  - [Race After Technology](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology) by Ruha Benjamin
  - [Design From the Margins](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/design-margins) (open-access!) by Afsaneh Rigot
  - [Algorithms of Oppression](https://algorithmsofoppression.com/) by Safiya Umoja Noble

- Along with the above, I like listening to [The CS-Ed Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5NtCNeqOxgtyh0FTb5OLf2?si=d7c31838c0ba48e4), which brings educators together to discuss teaching and equity in computer science. Another great resource for justice-oriented computer science education is this online (open-access!) textbook about [Critically Conscious Computing](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org/).

- Lastly, my top 3 albums of all time are [醜奴兒](https://open.spotify.com/album/4tfZSMFLsN0q2IULNLAJ40?si=vQAMBKJfSg6eTWdxtkU4rg) by No Party for Cao Dong, [Go Slow](https://open.spotify.com/album/3dsjH0D0Co0X7oii3a7FO8?si=uz78lverS4Cde93qwki2sA) by deca joins, and [1 of 1](https://open.spotify.com/album/1hG9lZDk2HqmOHMtuI3Zdj?si=IVYflggRTCaf_KdZ1DuIRQ) by SHINee - to give you something to listen to as you code.
